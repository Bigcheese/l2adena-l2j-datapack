Howdy-hi, adventurer!!<br>
The word around town is that you're celebrating your birthday today. Hooray!<br>
As a reward for all the time you've spent in this fair land, I'm here to present you with your official birthday gift. For every year of loyalty and dedication you have shown, I will reward you with <font color="LEVEL">one birthday celebration item and a 12-hour vitality replenishing buff</font>. However, you'll want to remember that if you are killed during the next 12 hours, your birthday buff will be gone for good. Or at least until next year.<br>
In addition, <font color="LEVEL">if you switch to a subclass while the buff is still active</font>, you will also lose the buff. So make sure you are on your preferred class before you receive the buff.<br>
I don't mean to be rude, but I've got other people to see, so I can't stay and chat all day. To receive your gifts, please click on the link below.<br><br><br>
