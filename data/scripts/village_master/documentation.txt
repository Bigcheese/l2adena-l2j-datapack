Scripts defined in the village_master folder control the AI for the dialogs of village masters.
In particular, changing occupations, creating/disolving a clan, and many more options given by 
village masters often require additional checks.  All such checks are implemented here.

For example, when a player attempts to change his occupation to SpellSinger, checks are needed 
in order to ensure that the player is currently an Elven Wizard and has successfully found all
the necessary quest items for this class change.  The dialogs offered are different when each of
the checks fails or succeeds.

The mechanics and syntax of all village_master scripts are the same as all quest scripts.  For more
details, please see "scripts/quests/documentation.txt"
