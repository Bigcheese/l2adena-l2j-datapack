A rogue must prove himself with his skills. My old friend Captain<font color="LEVEL"> Bezique</font> has tested the skills of Rogues for a long time and will assign you the Test of the Rogue. He stands at the entrance of the harbor on the west side of the village. I will permit you to change your profession to Rogue if you pass his test and bring me his letter of recommendation.<br>
