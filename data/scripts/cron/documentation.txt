Most of the scripts found within the "scripts" folder are initialized on server start, but 
do not run anything except when triggered by a player.  For scripts that need to be ran
automatically, without any player interaction, cron can be used.  
Using the format demonstrated in the example.py script, one can setup tasks that run 
automatically at server boot.  In addition, advanced users can include other classes from java
and setup timed tasks, such as special events that have universal drops for a certain period of time.

The server admins can feel free to add more folders like cron and include them in their servers.
