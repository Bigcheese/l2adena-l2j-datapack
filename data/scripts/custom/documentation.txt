Jython scripts added in the custom folder define quests and/or AI that are not normally part of 
the original Lineage 2 game.

In addition, "custom" is sometimes used as a temporary implementation of aspects of the original
game that are not yet fully implementable by L2J.  In this manner, partially accurate emulation
may be offered until a better method is implemented.

The mechanics and syntax of custom scripts are the same as all quest scripts.  For more
details, please see "scripts/quests/documentation.txt"
