Snow:<br><br>
Event Chest's are spawned at Fantasy Isle main square<br>
But they are not 'normal' chests. They are invisible...<br>
So... you must use magic to see that chests<br>
While you are transformed into Rabbit use <font color="LEVEL">Magic Eye</font> skill to see if near you are some chests.<br>
If you see it, target it and use <font color="LEVEL">Rabbit Tornado</font> skill to get reward.<br>
