Oh, thank you... Go to the Hills of Gold and hunt the <font color="LEVEL">Green Goblins, Hill Werewolves, Muertos Archers, Mountain Werewolf Chieftains, Muertos Guards and Mountain Fungus</font>, and bring back the <font color="LEVEL">claws of the monsters in the Hills of Gold</font>...<br>
For a reward, you can choose to receive Adena equally the number of claws you bring, or you can trade a set of <font color="LEVEL">50 claws for for an item</font>.<br>
Take care...
