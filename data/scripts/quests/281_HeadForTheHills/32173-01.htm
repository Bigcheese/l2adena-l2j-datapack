Since this island was opened to the outside world, there has been a dramatic increase in the number of goods and people entering through the port.<br>
The road from the port to the town winds through the Hills of Gold and is longer than the road through the forest, but large caravans prefer to use it because the ground is level and safe. Therefore, it is a very important road...<br>
Recently, however, the increased volume of traffic seems to have drawn the attention of the monsters nearby. I'm growing concerned about the number of monsters now in the Hills of Gold...<br>
A town such as ours that lacks manpower must resolve this problem through novice Kamael or wandering adventures.<br>
What do you think? Will you help us?<br>
