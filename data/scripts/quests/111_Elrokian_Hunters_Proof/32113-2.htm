<html><body>There was a man in my expedition who was searching for clues about the old Elroki warrior song, I think this song could help you win the Elroki's friendship... well, this man had a journal, and in it were the clues, but he was killed by velociraptors.  Now his journal is spread amongst the velociraptors.  Go kill them and bring me back the 50 pages of his journal.</body></html>
