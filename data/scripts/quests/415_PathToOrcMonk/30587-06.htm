As you know, Khavatari is a title given to the greatest Kabart martial art masters. Khavatari Rosheek has left on a journey of trial to develop his skills to a higher level. He has not been seen in the village since. According to the rumors, he is devoting himself to discipline alone near the <font color="LEVEL">Frozen Waterfalls in the northern part of the Immortal Plateau</font>.<br>
If you wish to learn from him, it will be good to prepare a gift. Take this Pomegranate. It will not be easy, but if you perform all the tasks that he gives you, you will receive a scroll! Bring that back to me!<br>
I must tell you one thing more before you leave! <font color="LEVEL">While you are taking the test to become a Monk, you must not use any weapons such as a knife or an axe! You are only allowed to use fist-type weapons or your bare hands!</font> If you break this rule, you cannot complete the test! Remember what I have told you!
