Gantaki Zu Urutu:<br>
The traditional martial art, Kabart, learned by the Paagrio Monk, is only taught to Orc Fighters that have strong physical strength and indomitable faith! I am sorry to say that you come up short both physically and spiritually. Acknowledge your limitations and work hard on your training for the time being! Come back after you earn more experience and reach level 18!
