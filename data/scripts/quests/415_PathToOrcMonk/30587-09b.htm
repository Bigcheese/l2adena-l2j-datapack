Ah, Khavatari Aren... That name has been forgotten for many years now.<br>
Not only did the Prefect Kasman learn from her, but so did the Flame Successor Akkan. But she went into seclusion a long time ago. Khavatari Hubai took her place and is teaching Kabart.<br>
Khavatari Aren lives as a hermit near the Valley of the Lords. I don't know why she chose such a place, but you can go there and meet her for yourself. If you're lucky, she'll tell you what the culmination of Kabart is.
