<html><body>Master Sione:<br>
While you were still training on the Isle of Souls, I was sent to the outer world to collect information.<br>
Compared to our male counterparts, we female Kamael engage in more subtle and skillful combat.<br>
Come back to me after you have gained enough experience to take the test to become a Warder. (Only characters who have reached level 18 or above may embark on this quest.)
