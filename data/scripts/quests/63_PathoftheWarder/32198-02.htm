(Reads the documents carefully.)<br>
Hmm... Good job...<br>
I will analyze the information you collected and draft further orders for you...<br>
(Master Gobie scribbles a note.)<br>
Here, take this letter to <font color="LEVEL">Captain Bathis of the Town of Gludio 
</font> and return to me.<br>
While you deliver this,I will dispatch our elite Xekerin Troops to capture 
Tak, a staff officer of the Ol Mahum.<br>
Go quickly!
