<html><body>Master Sione:<br>
Very well. First, I need a report about the military strength, chain of command 
and supply status of the "Abandoned Camp" forces that threaten this area.<br>
In order to obtain such a report, you must infiltrate the enemy at their very 
center. But I am worried about giving such a complicated mission to a 
greenhorn like you.<br>
Hmmm... Your mission will be to obtain that report from their leaders, 
whoever and wherever they may be.<br>
<font color="LEVEL">Go to the Abandoned Camp, defeat the Ol Mahum Novices</font> 
and obtain <font color="LEVEL">10 Ol Mahum orders.</font> Then elminate the 
<font color="LEVEL">Ol Mahum Patrols</font> and obtain <font color="LEVEL">5 Ol 
Mahum marks.</font> Good luck, soldier!
