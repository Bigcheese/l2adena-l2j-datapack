Ah! You have returned.<br>
And I see this has been another eventful errand...<br>
I too have been confused when dealing with some of these other races.<br>
The races of the Outer World and the evil creatures have complicated relations...<br>
Still, as an intelligence officer, it is my task to make sense of 
all this conflicting information.<br>
As you wrote in your report, we do not know whether the races of the Outer World 
and the evil creaturs communicate secretly or use each other to gain their 
own ends...<br>
Certainly, the relations between them are complicated and often bloody.<br>
