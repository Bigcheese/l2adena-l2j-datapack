Hmm... We have lost contact with the Xekerin Troops. That is not 
necessarily unusual during an operation, but they have remained out 
of contact longer this time...<br>
Still, since they are all elite warriors, I am not overly concerned...yet.<br>
I do have another document for you to deliver.<br>
Take this to <font color="LEVEL">Grand Master Tobias of the Dark Elf 
Guild in the Town of Gludio</font> and return.
