I would like to find out how the Core works in controlling other creatures. I think I will be able to figure it out with some help from you...<br>
There are all sorts of creatures inside the Cruma Tower, but among them is a creature called<font color="LEVEL"> Porta</font> which is thought to be a golem. Magic, spirits... We Dwarves don't know much about such things, but when it comes to 'artificials' like golems we know them better than anybody else. We must be able to find something out if we inspect the inside of Porta... To do so we need a sample of the heartstone.<br>
Please! Go into the tower and bring us<font color="LEVEL"> 1</font><font color="LEVEL"> Heartstone of Porta</font>.</body></html>
