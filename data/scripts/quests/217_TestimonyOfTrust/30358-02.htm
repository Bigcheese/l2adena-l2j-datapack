Trust... How dare you demand us such a thing. Remember? Dasparion who betrayed us was from your race! It was also the Human Magicians who sealed our tribe leader! For what reason do we have to trust the Humans? Do you think that what you people have done in the past can be forgotten with just a simple letter? You fools! I can't even understand!<br>
...However the<font color="LEVEL"> Chaotic Chronicle</font> which is mentioned in the letter is what we have been expecting also... When the time of disaster finally arrives, we might have to cooperate in order to survive... Mankind. I agree that even for such reasons, we have to recover the trust between us.<br>
But trust is not something that can be given away just like that. If you show us the right sincerity, I shall consider your proposal seriously.<br>
We have researched for hundreds of years to unseal the magic spell on our Chief Mitraell. He knows the secrets of Shilen and the<font color="LEVEL"> queen of destruction</font> better than anybody, so it is no exaggeration to say that he holds the key clue to the upcoming Chaotic Chronicle.<br>
<font color="LEVEL">I want you to collect the research materials on freeing our tribe leader.</font> I think that it is reasonable enough to lend a hand from a Human descendant, since it was your ancestors who sealed our Chief. Take this letter and meet<font color="LEVEL"> Magister Clayton of Dion Castle Town</font>. He will tell you about the materials to collect.</body></html>
