<html><body>Hierarch Asterios:<br>
Thank you, son of Human. The breath of the wind will be used to cleanup the forest atmosphere and the seeds of the fresh vegetation will be used to grow new life on the ground. As the Elven Forest recovers from its wounds gradually, so will faith in Humans recover.<br>
Take this letter with you. But don't expect absolute trust from us yet. The future of the two species depends largely on how Humans behave from now on... I will keep an eye on the Humans. Especially on young people like you...<br>
By the way, I know where you are heading for now. I bet you'll try to meet those poor Dark Elves... But I warn you. They are not worth trusting. Be careful.</body></html>
