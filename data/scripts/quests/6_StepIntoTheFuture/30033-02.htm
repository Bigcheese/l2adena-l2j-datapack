Hmmm... I see. It is certainly difficult to collect the travel expenses needed to go from this Talking Island to the mainland, especially to a far place like Giran. I have had an experience similar to yours, on a particularly difficult journey to the mainland.<br>
But it will be good for you to go and experience a city like Giran.  And you're in luck. A short while ago, I heard that Consul Sir Colin Windawood was looking for young people with great potential. You could be what he's looking for, I think.<br>
Here. Take this <font color="LEVEL">letter</font> and go see Consul <font color="LEVEL">Sir Colin Windawood.</font> Tell him that I recommended you, and he will support your travel needs. Yes ... I'm sure he will, because he's the sort who cares greatly and worries about the future of this Talking Island as well as the entire Aden Kingdom.<br>
The Consul has somewhat of a wandering disposition, so he is not usually at his office. You will likely have to go looking for him. I head that he was taking a walk near the <font color="LEVEL">Obelisk of Victory</font> in the mornings, so check that area first.
