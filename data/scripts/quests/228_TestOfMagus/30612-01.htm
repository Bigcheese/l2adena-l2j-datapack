I am well aware that Perina is suffering because of that monstrous flower ... I have thought over and over about the problem for the past few days... My conclusion is that there is no other way than to find the creature before it harms anyone.<br>
There is not only one singing flower! There are 3 of them--The nightmare singing flower, the phantom singing flower, and the darkness singing flower. We have to find all 3 of them.<br>
