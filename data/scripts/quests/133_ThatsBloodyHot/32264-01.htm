Are you interested in Hellbound Island?<br>
I'm sure there are many connections...<br>
Not to mention the people of this Crystal Oracle who were taken captive...<br>
That is because Hellbound is the stronghold of the notorious Beleth...<br>
Is your business related to the Ivory Tower?<br>
Or is it connected to the Giran aristocracy<br>
I don't know what it is specifically, but you should reconsider carefully.<br>
