<html><body>Warehouse Keeper Valkon:<br>
How long will you linger at the level of an apprentice? Don't you have any ambitions for promoting to a higher rank? I hope you are not mistaken that you have already reached a certain level. Don't you think that you should work harder to challenge the<font color="LEVEL"> Trial of the Guildsman</font>? You will not be recognized as a true member of the Dwarf society if you don't pass that test. If you don't care about being treated as a greenhorn for the rest of your life, I won't speak anymore.<br>
(Quest for Raiders or Artisans, level 35 and above.)
