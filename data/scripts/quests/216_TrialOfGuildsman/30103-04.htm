A Dwarf apprentice will work in a stope to strengthen their body and spirit, as well as being trained for protecting their own body. When one completes the basic training, they will come back to the Dwarf Village and accumulate experience while helping the Elders of the guilds with their chores.<br>
When they finally pass the exam given by the guild and gain the title of a Raider or Artisan, that is when they go beyond the level of an apprentice. But even then, that's not enough to become an official member of the union. Only when you pass the<font color="LEVEL"> Trial of the Guildsman</font>, shall you be accepted as a true union member.<br>
If you are planning to inherit the skills of the higher members of the union and receive the title of a Master Raider or Warsmith it is essential that you pass this test.<br>
