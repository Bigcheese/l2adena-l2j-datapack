You forgot? Lazy bones and forgetful at that!<br>
My brother said he would stop by at the<font color="LEVEL"> abandoned mine east of the village</font>, and then go to the<font color="LEVEL"> east end of the Dwarven kingdom</font> to praise the work of Lucien. After that, he said he was going to watch the wide ocean on the<font color="LEVEL"> northern coastline</font>.<br>
Don't forget this time!
