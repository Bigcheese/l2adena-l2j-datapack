Do you bring a message from Santiago? In search of the truth, are you? Your timing could not be better.<br>
 I have a favor to ask you. There is a Black Priest named<font color="LEVEL"> Uruha</font> in the Neutral Zone. She invaded this forest with her spirits known as<font color="LEVEL"> black willow</font>. You must destroy these spirits.<br>

The black willow are located near the<font color="LEVEL"> Waterfalls in the northern 
part of the Neutral Zone</font>.<font color="LEVEL"> After destroying them, go 
to Uruha and warn her not to come to the Elven Forest again.</font>After you do 
this we can discuss God.
