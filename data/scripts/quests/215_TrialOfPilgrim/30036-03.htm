Nahir... May his poor spirit rest in peace now...<br>
Thank you. Now listen to Nahir's story. He was once a faithful follower of Einhasad. But while he was helping his friend who happened to be a servant of Shilen, he incurred Einhasad's hatred and was turned into a monster. And until this day, he is roaming around the dark underground. Do you understand what I am saying? Einhasad who is known as the Goddess of sacrifice and life, has in fact, the opposite face of jealousy, and destruction. Of course in the religion, they only mention the side of sacrifice and life...<br>
The truth that you are looking for looks like this. It's bitter truth, isn't it? But that doesn't mean that you'll have to end your pilgrimage here. I bet you are seeking the truth about Eva as well? In that case you should go and see<font color="LEVEL"> Andellia of the Elven Village</font>.
