<html><body>Wiseman Casian:<br>
Nice to meet you inquirer. My name is Casian, some call me the Wiseman of Wastelands.<br>
The Elves or the Dark Elves that you have met... We can't tell right or wrong from what they said. The God's nature is not something that we can define so easily. Even the Gods are only one part of the big universe... The Gods each have their role, respectively. We cannot understand their intentions... And if you don't understand, you don't realize...<br>
There is no need to be complicated. We each do our best in our daily lives... and go our own ways...<br>
Thank you for listening to my tedious lecture. I will give this book to you. Now I would like you to return to<font color="LEVEL"> Hermit Santiago</font> who initiated this pilgrimage in the first place.
