Maphr as the goddess of abundance and prosperity?! Foolish people, they don't know anything! Just look at the silly Dwarves in this town. They are literally crazy and they are always dashing here and there to collect more money... It is simply ridiculous! Miserable creatures who would even venture to scrape out their goddess's heart if it were for money! And they won't hesitate to uncover things that shouldn't be part of this world!<br>
Maphr is indeed the goddess of abundance and prosperity, but that also means that she is responsible for all poverty and downfalls! Why can't you see this simple fact? They have already experienced bankruptcy once before... Tsk tsk...<br>
Take this badge and take heed. Prosperity and poverty are just like the two sides of one coin!
