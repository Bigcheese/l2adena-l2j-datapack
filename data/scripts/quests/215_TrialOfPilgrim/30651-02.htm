Maphr as the God of Abundance and Prosperity?! Foolish people, they don't know anything! Just look at the silly Dwarves in this town. They are literally crazy and they are always dashing here and there to collect some more money... Ha ha ha, that is simply ridiculous! Miserable creatures who would even dare to scrape out their God's heart if it were for money! And they won't hesitate to pull out the things that should not be presented to this world!<br>
<font color="LEVEL">Maphr is indeed the God of Abundance and Prosperity, but that also means that he is in charge of all poverty and downfalls! Why can't you see this simple fact!</font> They have already experienced bankruptcy once before... Tsk tsk...<br>
