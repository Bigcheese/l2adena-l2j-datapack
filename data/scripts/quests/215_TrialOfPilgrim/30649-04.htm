Hot, hot... My spirt is burning...<br>
This... What is this? The flame of the fighting spirit... A mind that pure fighters have.<br>
What? What is that again? Who are you? What? Ahh!! Don't come near! Too hot! Flame of destruction? It swallows everything and leaves only black ashes...<br>
Is it finished ...?<br>
No, there's more! Flame exists in ashes... Yes, you! All important holy flame! Energy that moves the earth, the flame of life...<br>
Here, absurdly small being ... Want to feel more? However this is all you can handle... Before your body and soul all burn away... Now it's over...
