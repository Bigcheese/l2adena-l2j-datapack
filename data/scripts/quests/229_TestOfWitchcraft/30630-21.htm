<html><body>Orim of the Shadow:<br>
The prison of spirits shall be sealed in the name of I, Orim of the Shadow! It's done. The spirits of Zeruel is locked inside the box and the box is sealed with the magic of light. The 6 jewels that function as the lock, shall be safely kept by me.<br>
 As for the sword and crystal, I shall return them to their owners. ...but I still can't get rid of this nasty feeling that somebody is watching us.<font color="LEVEL"> Did you ever receive an unwanted gift from anyone?</font><br>
