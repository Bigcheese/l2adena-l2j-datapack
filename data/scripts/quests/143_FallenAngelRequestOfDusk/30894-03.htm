I do not know its location, but they have requested that they be allowed to consult something called the <font color="LEVEL">Sealed Prophecy - Path of the God.</font><br>
Your predecessor obtained this document, and they undoubtedly believe that it contains clues about the angel's whereabouts.<br>
You will be able to obtain the angel's message using a unique Echo Crystal that can store sound.<br>
If you have more questions, ask <font color="LEVEL">Grand Master Tobias in the town of Gludio</font>.<br>
Take the Sealed Prophecy - Path of the God with you.
