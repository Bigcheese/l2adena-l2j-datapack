Tataru Zu Hestui:<br>
If the magic of an Orc Mystic is simply to request favors of the spirits, and borrow their power temporarily, Orc Shamans are those who have been enlightened with the secret of flame, to be spell casters with spiritual authority that commands the spirits. They are able to command spirits for curing the hurt and breathing power into our allies. All enemies kneel down in front of this mighty power!<br>
