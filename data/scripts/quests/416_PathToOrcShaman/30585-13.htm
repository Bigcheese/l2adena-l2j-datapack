Tataru Zu Hestui:<br>
Even if you have learned the language of flame, if you do not know the names of the spirits, you cannot control them. Learning the ninety-nine names of the spirits is a trial that must be taken to become a true Shaman! I hope you are patient and overcome in your test to become an Orc Shaman. Dejakyar Lamme! May the protection of the flame be with you!
