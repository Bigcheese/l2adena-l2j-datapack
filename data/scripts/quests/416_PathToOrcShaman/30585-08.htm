Tataru Zu Hestui:<br>
I will make you a mask with the kasha bear pelt and kasha bladespider husk that you have brought. It is a mask that looks like the kasha bear that the Hestui tribe use as a totem. It is a necessary item in order to learn the language of flame when you meet the totem spirit.<br>
The fiery egg obtained from the scarlet salamander contains an unborn spirit whose existence is not yet ordained. It is truly a valuable item, fit to offer to the totem spirit as a gift.<br>
Now go seek the<font color="LEVEL"> Hestui Totem Spirit</font>. You can meet it if you go to the Wastelands, south of the Immortal Plateau. Dejakyar Lamme! May the blessings of the flame be with you.
