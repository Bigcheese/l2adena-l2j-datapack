If you win the game, the master running it owes you the 
appropriate amount. The higher the round, the bigger the 
payout. That's why the game anly allows you to win up to 
8 round in a row. If -- and that's a big if -- you manage 
to win 8 straight times, the game will end.<br>
<br>
Keep in mind that <font color="LEVEL">if you lose any of the rounds, 
you get nothing</font>. That's fair warning, my friend. Here's how the 
prize system works:<br>
<br>
1 winning round: 40,000 adena<br>
2 winning rounds: 80,000 adena<br>
3 winning rounds: 110,000 adena, D-grade Enchant Weapon Scroll<br>
4 winning rounds: 199,000 adena, C-grade Enchant Weapon Scroll<br>
5 winning rounds: 388,000 adena, 1 recipe for a B-grade weapon<br>
6 winning rounds: 675,000 adena, 1 essential ingredient for a B-grade weapon<br>
7 winning rounds: 1,284,000 adena, 2 B-grade Enchant Weapon Scrolls, 2 B-grade Enchat Armor Scrolls<br>
8 winning rounds: 2,384,000 adena, 1 A-grade Enchant Weapon Scroll, 2 A-grade Enchat Armor Scrolls<br>
<br>
My advice is to identify what you'd like to win and then to play for that prize. Any questions?<br>
