Hmm... Although I can't read this scribble, it must be <font color="LEVEL">Lekon's Certificate</font>. You managed to acquire the Aerial Transformed Object, eh? Now you are ready for a full-scale mission.<br>
Let me ask you a question. What do you think is the best methode to fight evil? There are many opinions, of course. But I think the best answer is to use that evil against itself.<br>
When evil suddenly appeared in Gracia, we were curious about the source of that power. We studied it as best as we could. As a result, we learned to make weapons, shileds and many other useful battle tools using that evil spirit.<br>
Unfortunately, it requires a huge sacrifice to obtain the necessary materials. You can only get them, in fact, by killing those evil creatures. I wish I could explain in greater detail, but I'm just a simple soldier. If you wish to speak with an expert in such matters, speak with <font color="LEVEL">Special Products Broker Kutran at Kucereus' clan outpost</font>. He will be able to tell you more.
