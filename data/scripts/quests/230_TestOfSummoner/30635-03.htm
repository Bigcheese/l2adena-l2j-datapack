<html><body>Summoner Almors:<br>
I suppose you are aware of the rules? The first attack shall be made by the assistants! The battle between the animals of the Summoner! If the Summoner attacks the opposite Summoner's animal, it is invalid!<br>
Is that enough review? Shall we begin the battle, then?<br>
