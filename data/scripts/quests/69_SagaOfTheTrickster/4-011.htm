<html><body>Rodenpicula:<br>
I have avoided pursuing my vendetta against the goddess of light because I hoped that the time would come 
when I could bequeath this magical stone to one of my heirs capable of attaining true power and insight.<br>
Now use that Resonance Amulet wisely.<br>
I do not know how you will deal with the truth -- that we were all created as weapons to help the 
Giants oppose the gods...<br>
But bear this in mind: the future is open to you, and you must now judge how to use your strength for yourself.<br>
...<br> I must pursue and destroy our injured enemies...<br>
Farewell...
