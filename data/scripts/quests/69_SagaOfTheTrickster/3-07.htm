According to my investigations, this Resonance Amulet can be repaired with the Divine Stone of Wisdom possessed by both Ketra 
Orcs and the Varka Silenos.<br>
But I cannot leave here.<br>
I know you are on a quest to find the Tablets, so this is a task well suited for you.<br>

You must earn one tribe's trust obtain their Stone.<br>
Which tribe will you choose?<br>
