<html><body>Magister Justin:<br>
The Tablets of Vision are scatterd throughout the world.<br>
Each requires a different Resonance Amulet in order to communicate with it.<br>
This means that the Amulets and Tablets are uniquely paired.<br>
The Amulet I have given you matches the first Tablet of Vision, which is located 
to the south of the Tower of Insolence. Go find it!
