<html><body>Hierarch Kekropus:<br>
The woman in the blue dress distributed these Tablets of Vision all over the world.<br>
It will be very difficult to find the locations of them all, hidden as they are in the 
secret and dangerous places.<br>
Even if you do find their locations, you will still require a mystical object called the 
Resonance Amulet in order to decipher the secret of the Tablets...<br>
The Demon Beleth is also seeking the knowledge contained within the Tablets -- you must 
prevent him from acquiring it at all costs!<br>
