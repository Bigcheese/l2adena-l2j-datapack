What, you don't know? How could you not know? Roxxy is the most beautiful woman on Talking Island... She's also very talented and knowledgeable in the ways of magic. They say she studied at Oren's Ivory Tower. She's also a member of the Gatekeeper Guild that uses the "Gate of Time and Space" to connect many villages.<br>
So how could such a great woman... accept my love? I think about confessing my love to her hundreds of times each day, but then I give up. I just don't have the courage to do it. When I thought about what would happen if she were to reject me... I stop walking without realizing it. It's been a week since I wrote the letter for her, but I haven't sent it.<br>
Do you think I can ask you for a favor...? Can you... deliver my letter to Roxxy for me?<br>
