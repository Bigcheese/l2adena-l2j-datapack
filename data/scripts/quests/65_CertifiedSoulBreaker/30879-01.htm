Why did you come to me? The cargo has been delayed by a storm. If that's what you're here for, you'll have to wait a little longer. We're not delaying things on purpose, I promise you. <br>You're looking for someone? There are many people moving about this wharf... I'm afraid you'll have to be a little more specific... <br>
