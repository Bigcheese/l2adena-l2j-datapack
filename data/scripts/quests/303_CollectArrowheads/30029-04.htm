There are many orcs on Talking Island, but the tunath orcs are at the<font color="LEVEL"> Elven Ruins</font>. You will be able to find arrowheads of tunath orc snipers. If you don't know how to find the ruins, ask Guard Kenyos.<br>
They are not merely for my private purposes, I plan to donate some to Cedric's Training Hall for exhibition, so please bring back ten arrowheads.
