By the gods! You are as forgetful as Brunon ... I will explain one more time! Don't forget!<br>
First go to the weapon & armor shop and get a sack of Boomboom Powder from <font color="LEVEL">Armor Merchant Shari</font> ...<br>
Then, go to the general shop and get a pair of Mining Boots from <font color="LEVEL">Accessory Merchant Garita.</font> ...<br>
After that, go to the warehouse and get a case of Redstone Beer from <font color="LEVEL">Warehouse Chief Reed</font> ...<br>
Finally, pick up a Miner's Pick from <font color="LEVEL">Blacksmith Brunon</font>. If Brunon's forgetfulness kicks in, the object I gave you will be of help. That's the best remedy for forgetfulness.
