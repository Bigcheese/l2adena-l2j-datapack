Ha ha! Very nice! This is the list of things that you need to bring. Let me see ... What were they ...?<br>Ah! First, go to the weapon & armor shop and get a sack of Boomboom Powder from <font color="LEVEL">Armor Merchant Shari</font> ...<br>
Then go to the general shop and get a pair of Mining Boots from <font color="LEVEL">Accessory Merchant Garita.</font> ...<br>
After that, go to the warehouse and get a case of Redstone Beer from<font color="LEVEL"> Warehouse Chief Reed</font> ...<br>
Finally, pick up a Miner's Pick from <font color="LEVEL">Blacksmith Brunon</font>.<br>
But I'm worried about the last one, because Blacksmith Brunon is very forgetful. He forgets orders and says strange things ... Just in case ... Here, take this. It is a specific remedy that works wonders for forgetfulness.
