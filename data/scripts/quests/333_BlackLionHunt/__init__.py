However, it seems to me that the business savvy of a dwarf is inborn  No matter how hard humans try, I dont think they can keep up with dwarves.<br>On top of that, adding insult to injury, evil spirits frequently attack the guilds cargo wagons and steal their valuable goods making the humans suffer great losses.<br>",
