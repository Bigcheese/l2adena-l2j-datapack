Excellent! Visit either of the 2 Kamalokas we can enter from Heine, kill the Kaneus there and extract their cellular tissues.<br>
You will face the <font color="LEVEL">Blade Otis and Weird Bunei</font> Kaneus. The Blade Otis is much weaker, so I'd advise that you pursue it first.<br>
When you have extracted all the cellular tissues of the 2 creatures, take them to <font color="LEVEL">Magister Minevia</font> at the Temple of Einhasad. I know she and the other Sages will appreciate your efforts.<br>
Good hunting!
