The infernium ore that the Iron Gate Guild needs to construct a warehouse has been stolen by monsters. Recover the infernium ore and take it back to me. If you gather enough pieces, you can come back and we'll play one round of bingo. If you win, you'll receive a prize from the Iron Gate Guild.<br>
