Great one...<br>
I remember your parents.<br>
I remember your birth.<br>
I remeber when you left these shores for the Outer World.<br>
And I remember when you returned to this island of ours.<br>
Many before you refused to walk this path.<br>
But you are unafraid to step boldy into the dangerous and unclear future. Truly you are Kamael of the Kamael!<br>
