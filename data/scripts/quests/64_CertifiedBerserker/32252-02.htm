Yes, the Berserker Guild uses a special message plate.<br>
It usually gest mixed with the food monsters love to eat and is consumed. Since the material 
the plate is made from is indigestible, the next team is able to collect the plate by killing 
the monsters near the route the convoy took.<br>
If we assume that the convoy took the planned route, then we may get the plate from the Road 
Scavengers in Deat Pass.
