<html><body>Master Tenain:<br>
We have avoided the brunt of the raiders' attack and are withdrawing secretly. However, 
they have dispatched a small force to alert the main enemy units of our location.<br>
First, we must eliminate that force before they contact the main enemy group. They 
moved off to the west, so I contacted Master Entien in the Town of Dion to pursue 
them. You should go to Dion Castle Village and help in the pursuit.<br>
I will leave any messages from Harkilgamed beneath the bridge.<br>
