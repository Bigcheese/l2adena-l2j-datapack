I see you have defeated the Breka Orcs as ordered. Well done!<br>
Unfortunately, the enemy has learned the location of the item. We will face more 
than simply Breka Orcs in the future... We are in the process of moving the item 
to a safer location. Those entrusted with doing so just left, so please follow them 
and help. They should be near Death Pass by now.
