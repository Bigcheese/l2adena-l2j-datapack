Yes, sir. Here is the situation, then:<br>
The Breka Orcs have launched a series of attacks to steal the item we 
are protecting. We do not have the numbers for a static defense, so we have 
determined to go on the offensive and attack their stronghold to throw them 
into confusion. Go to the <font color="LEVEL">Breka Stronghold</font> and 
defeat <font color="LEVEL">the Breka Orcs, the Breka Orc Archers, the Breka 
Orc Warriors, the Breka Orc Shamans and the Breka Orc Overlords.</font> Slay 
them and bring back <font color="LEVEL">20 Breka Orc heads</font> as proof.
