<html><body>Magister Rohmer:<br>
I, Rohmer, thank you for your help. Now, I can weaken the power of Maille Lizardmen's magic even further.<br>
Rohmer says that this fight is not over yet. The Maille Lizardmen outnumber us and have countless shamans. They will endlessly try to strenghten and recover their magic. Rohmer hopes you can help us again in the future.<br>
I, Rohmer, cannot compensate your efforts with wealth or materials, but I'll at least try to make your future path easier.<br>
(This quest is a repetitive quest. You can start it again through Guard Praga.)
