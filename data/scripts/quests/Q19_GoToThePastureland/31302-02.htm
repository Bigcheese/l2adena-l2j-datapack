Is that you? Here. Take this meat! <font color="LEVEL">Farm Manager Tunatun</font> sent it to me, but it's disgusting.<br>
I see red just thinking about it! I can't decide if he doesn't know any better, or if he's trying to slip one by me. Between you and me, I won't buy anything from him!<br>
Not if he paid me! But you might like it...
