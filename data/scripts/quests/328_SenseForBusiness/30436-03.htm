Good. Spit on the ground and shake on it. Now we have a contract with the goddess of earth, Maphr, as our witness. Now listen to what I have to say.<br>
Do you remember the eight basic ingredients used for magic research I told you about earlier? We can find some of them in this area. If you'll hunt<font color="LEVEL"> monster eyes</font>, you can get their useful<font color="LEVEL"> monster eye carcasses,</font> and once in a while, you can even obtain a<font color="LEVEL">monster eye lens</font>, and this is a very valuable item. They say Dwarves use these to make something called "eye glasses."<br>
Also, if you hunt the<font color="LEVEL"> basilisk</font>, you can get its gizzard. The basilisk swallows the pebbles of the wastelands to aid its digestion, but inside, they are mixed with jade shards. So we can obtain jade from the<font color="LEVEL"> basilisk gizzard</font>.<br>
You can find monster eyes on the coast near here. The basilisk can be found within the Wastelands. There are also monster eyes in the Wastelands, but they are much more dangerous than those on the coast, so you must be careful. But you may be able to find items that are that much more precious, so it is worth taking the challenge to hunt<br>
From now on, the items you bring to me I will sell to the Ivory Tower. I have already signed a contract with the magicians of the Ivory Tower and fixed the price as well. I will give you 30% of the item price I have agreed to take. So please bring back as much as possible. Well then, may the blessing of the earth be with you, partner.</body></html>
