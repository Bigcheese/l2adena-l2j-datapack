You've brought me twenty bottles of nectar. I can make a honey from this. But if I add royal jelly to the nectar, I will be able to make a more flavorful, golden honey. For this, I need<font color="LEVEL"> ten bottles</font> of royal jelly. It is such a rare ingredient that you may have trouble finding it.<br>
What do you think? Should I just create a honey from the nectar you have brought me? Or will you try to gather more royal jelly?<br>
