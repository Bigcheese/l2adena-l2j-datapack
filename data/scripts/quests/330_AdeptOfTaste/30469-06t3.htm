I see you have returned. I have already heard. It is not easy to receive a favorable review from the Food Critic Mirien. However, we must not be satisfied at this level. Next time, please find me better ingredients so I can try again.<br>
It seems that the lord has already been informed of the results. I did not receive a high score, but the lord sent some prize money. As promised, I will give a portion to you.<br>
And as a gift, I will give you a memo with the secrets of my cooking. When I later become a famous cook, the secrets may sell for a high price to rich epicures ... Ha Ha!<br>
I suppose you have your own dreams as well? Be patient and persevere. Then someday you will fulfill that dream.
