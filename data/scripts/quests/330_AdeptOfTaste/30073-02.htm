<html><body>Guard Jacob:<br>
To make the honey, I need enough nectar to fill twenty bottles.<br>
You can obtain the nectar by hunting giant bees like the<font color="LEVEL"> bloody bee</font> and the<font color="LEVEL"> great stinger.</font> But the great stingers are very large and ferocious, so be careful.<br>
If you are lucky, you may be able to obtain something called<font color="LEVEL"> royal jelly</font> from worker bees are yet a week. If I add royal jelly to the nectar, I will be able to make a more flavorful, golden honey. But for that I need<font color="LEVEL"> 10 bottles of royal jelly.</font> It is such a rare ingredient that you may have trouble finding it.
