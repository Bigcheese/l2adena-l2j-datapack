Priest Greymore:<br>
Well, this could be dangerous, but I think you look brave.<br>
I need you to go and capture <font color=LEVEL>Master of Splendor Anays</font> that hides here in the Monastery of Silence, guarding the Holy Grail.<br>
You must confront Anays and take a <font color=LEVEL>Mark of Splendor</font> back to me. I won't reward you if you don't obtain this item.<br>
Take your friends to this mission, maybe they can help you!<br>
