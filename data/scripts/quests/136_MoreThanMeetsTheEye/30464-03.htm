<html><body>Magister Clayton:<br>
You have brought back all the Glass Jaguar Crystals? Good! Then I will create the Blank Book of Seal for you immediately...<br>
(Clayton takes out some arcane ingredients and begins to create the tome.<br>
He grinds up and liquefies the Glass Jaguar Crystals, then uses the mixture to each in complicated patterns in the margins of each page of the Blank book of Seal.)<br>
Ah, finished! I must admit to being curious to know what manner of great magic it will carry. I suspect that you are experimenting with a new spell, so I bid you farewell...and good luck.
