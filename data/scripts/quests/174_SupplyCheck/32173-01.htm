Sigh... It's so very hectic right now... This season's resupplying day is approaching? and I'm in trouble... Hey, can you help me? I've gotten really busy since the opening of the island... The troops are currently out on assignment, and I need the supply manifest from each shop to check on the status of their preparations. I'm in a real jam here unless you agree to help me out...<br>
