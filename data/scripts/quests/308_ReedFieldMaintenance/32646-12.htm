You haven't done the mission that Dr. Helvetica gave you. We can't really trust you like that. In this case, I will have to deduct some fee from the reward.<br>
How about it? If you finish that mission you will be able to the reward as a whole, do you want your reward later? Do you want to reveice the reward now even if you will have a small bit of loss?<br>
