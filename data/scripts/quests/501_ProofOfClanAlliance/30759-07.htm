Tell me, how does the poison taste? Everything growing dark, is it? That would be death coming for you. I fear that soon we will need to add another grave here... Will your comrades find and bring back all the ingredients in time?<br>Oh, I do hate to see you in such pain. Would you care for some hints? <br>Herb of Vanor can be obtained from <font color="LEVEL">vanor silenos</font>.  Herb of Harit can be obtained from <font color="LEVEL">harit lizardmen</font>. Herb of ol mahum can be obtained from <font color="LEVEL">ol mahums</font>. <font color="LEVEL">The Shamans</font> will have the herbs.<br>In order to obtain the Blood of Eva, you must visit <font color="LEVEL">Witch Athrea</font>. She is my younger sister. Some time ago she left for <font color="LEVEL">Hardin's Academy</font> to meet with Grand Magus Hardin.<br>Remember that <font color="LEVEL">when your clan members bring back all the ingredients, you must gather them up and bring them to me. I will create the Antidote for you.</font></body></html>
