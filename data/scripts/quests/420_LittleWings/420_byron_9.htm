<html><body>Guard Byron:<br>
Aren't you the person that left with the pure white fairy stone to meet a fairy? 
What...?! Looking at you, it appears that you had a fight in the valley. Did you 
lose the pure white fairy stone? Oh, that's really too bad...<br>
If you still want to meet a fairy, then you'll just have to make another fairy stone. 
Did you make the last fairy stone by asking for wisdom from<font color="LEVEL"> Sage Cronos</font>? 
You'll have to go back to him and ask again.</body></html>
