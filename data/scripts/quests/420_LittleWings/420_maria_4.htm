<html><body>Maria:<br>... This memo...? Hmm... Fairy stone?<br>... Hmm, I don't think it will be very difficult 
to make it according to this ingredient list. I can make it for you quickly if you get the 
ingredients for me. I'll take a look... Let's check the ingredients that you brought. Coal, charcoal... 
gemstones... silver and toad lord back skins... Everything looks good. OK then, wait a moment. 
I'll start the manufacturing process shortly.<br>... Gemstone with base.. Polish with silver. 
Umm, from here it's very similar to crystal of purity.<br>Then reprocess with stone of purity again? 
Hmm, is it really necessary to do this? Anyway...<br>
