<html><body>Drake Zwov:<br>Hey! This was a complete waste of time for me! Take a look at this. I've been bitten all over by the spiders! 
I did nothing but suffer...! Huh? You succeeded? You found the eggs! Oh, I'm really thankful! Thank you! You're a really 
good person... Whew!<br>I'll take a look... One, two, three... All 20 look like they're in good shape... Huh? There's one 
too many?! How could this have happened...? How strange! I guess I must have laid 21 eggs... No, that can't be right... 
Well, what do I care? This isn't my egg. OK, I'll give it to you. If you take this to<font color="LEVEL"> Fairy Mimyu</font>, 
she'll incubate it and make it into a hatchling for you. It doesn't look like my egg, but it's definitely going to hatch into 
a cute baby. Please raise it well...!</body></html>
