<html><body>Wyrm Shamhai:<br>You want one of my eggs…? I see… is that what you want? In other times, as soon as I heard someone asking 
me to give him any of my eggs, I would drag him up into the sky and drop him to his death. But today, I will have to make 
an exception and listen to what you have to say…<br>All right. I’ll accept your offer. However, I’ll take you up on your 
offer on the condition that you will first have to find and bring back all of<font color="LEVEL"> my 20 eggs</font>. 
Understand? My eggs were stolen by the<font color="LEVEL"> dead seekers</font> who mainly inhabit the place that humans 
call the<font color="LEVEL"> Execution Ground</font>. I will give you one of my scales. Kill the dead seekers and find 
the 20 eggs that have the same pattern as my scale and bring them to me. Only after you complete this task, you will become 
a master of one of my babies!</body></html>
