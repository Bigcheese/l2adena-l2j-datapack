What did you say? A fairy stone delux will break when it is smeared with blood…? 
Gosh, this must be a really fastidious stone. By the way, what’s up with you… 
If Byron told you not to engage in combat, you should have followed his instructions… 
What a bummer! Oh well… what’s the point of telling this to an adventurer like yourself. 
I’m just wasting my breath. Aren’t you tired by now? What do you think? 
I think you should just give up on making a fairy stone delux and just focus on creating a 
regular fairy stone. It’s easier to make and easier to carry around… huh? What do you say?
