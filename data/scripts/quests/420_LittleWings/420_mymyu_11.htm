OK, let's hatch it...?
<br>.............OK, OK.... It's moving. You're doing a good job...<br>
............Right! That's the weak spot. I'll help too... One, two, three..! Once more... One! Two! Three!<br>
Whew, OK... There's a crack... Alright, now come out under your own power! This person right here is your mother. ...Your mother who will feed you and teach you many things!<br>
OK, out, out, out, out....! A little more!<br>
OK... You did a good job...! Thank you!<br>
OK... I'll take a look... Perhaps it's because it wasn't held by its mother, but this kid looks a bit weak.<br>
Um, do you still have the fairy dust that I gave you before? Sorry, but could you give me some of that? I want to do something for the kid...<br>
