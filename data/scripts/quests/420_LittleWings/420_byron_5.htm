Um, you've come again with a fairy stone again, huh? 
Wait... This one is a bit different than last time... If this is an ordinary fairy stone and not 
a pure white fairy stone, it won't become broken even if it gets blood on it from creatures in 
Fairy Valley. Don't worry. It'll be fine as you go to<font color="LEVEL"> the very deepest part 
of the north of the Valley</font>.</body></html>
