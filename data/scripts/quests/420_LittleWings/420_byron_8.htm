<html><body>Guard Byron:<br>
You haven't left for Fairy Valley yet? If you want to meet a fairy, you've got to take the pure white fairy stone and go to the<font color="LEVEL"> very deepest part of Fairy Valley</font>. If you're lucky, you may be able to meet a fairy there. But you've got to be careful. If the blood of any creature living in Fairy Valley gets on the pure white fairy stone that you have, it will break. Therefore, you<font color="LEVEL"> must not fight</font>.
