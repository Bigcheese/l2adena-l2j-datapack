Hurry and take them to their mother! Their mother will be waiting for them! She'll be really happy! They spent 
a long time away from their mother but fortunately they still look fine. But I don't know what will happen later 
so it would be best if you hurry and take them to their mother. OK, I'm sure she'll let you keep one of them.</body></html>
