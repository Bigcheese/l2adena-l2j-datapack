whether your legs are short or long. I understand. My eggs were stolen by thieves called<font color="LEVEL"> road scavengers
</font>. They attacked by hitting me and then stole my eggs. I have no idea who told them to do that. They have set up their 
camp<font color="LEVEL"> near the valley that Humans call "Death Pass."</font><br>If you will get<font color="LEVEL"> all 
20 eggs</font> of mine that they took, I'll do anything that you ask of me if I'm able to do it. Take my scale. If you have 
this, you'll be able to easily distinguish my eggs from the other items they have stolen.</body></html>
