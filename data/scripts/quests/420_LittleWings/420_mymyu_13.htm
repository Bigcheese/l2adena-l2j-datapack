Good, good... OK! La, la, la, la...! This is hatchling armor. If the child has this, it will look a bit more dashing. As you are the mother, would you like to do the honors.? OK... The movement of the arms and legs seems to be quite healthy. If it's fed well and taken care of, it will grow up to be healthy. But the world is a very, very dangerous place so we can't just leave it like this.<br>
I'll hide the baby in the Elven world under my powers. Don't worry. Instead, I'll give you this flute. You'll be able to call the child to your side at any time just by blowing on this flute.<br>
OK, bye... I'll take good care of the baby... If something happens to this cute infant, I'll cast the very strongest curse on you that I can! OK, bye..!
