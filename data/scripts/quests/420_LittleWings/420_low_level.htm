Hmm... It does seem that a lot of people are looking for hatchlings. I know all about the basic ones. When young, they're hatchlings. Then later they get bigger and become striders that can carry people around. Later, they grow into wyverns that fly around in the sky. In fact, I've seen one before. It's pretty cute when young but you would never think that after it grows up and becomes a wyvern. Ha, ha... And it's also said that such a hatchling will grow up according to the situation of its owner. If an owner doesn't have a clan hall, the hatchling won't grow up to become a strider no matter what one does. And to get a wyvern, it seems that you've got to have at least a castle...<br>
Anyway, a hatchling will only serve an owner that has a certain degree of ability. It looks to me like it's still a bit early for you to become the owner of a hatchling but...<br>
(This is a quest that can only be carried out by someone of level 35 or above.)
