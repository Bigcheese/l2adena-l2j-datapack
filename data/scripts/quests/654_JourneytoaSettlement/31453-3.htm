Well, the fact is... <font color="LEVEL">It is necessary to write down the spells to erase the seal. For instance, it is a parchment</font>.<br>
Please go to Wall of Argos, and take a small amount of skin of the antelope. It only has to hunt <font color="LEVEL">Canyon Antelope</font> and <font color="LEVEL">Canyon Antelope Slave</font>. These skins are dressed, it becomes the substitute of the parchment.<br> 
Oh, that reminds it!<br>
<font color="LEVEL">Only the leader of the multi-party command channel</font> has to use the scroll to erase the seal. Someone of companions have a scroll. Therefore, it is not at all members that take the skin of Antelope. Did you understand?
