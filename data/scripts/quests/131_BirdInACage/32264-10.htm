<html><body>Priest Kanis:<br>
To enter the <font color="LEVEL">Water Dragon's Cave</font>, you will need 1 Contaminated Crystal. The Contaminated Crystal can be found at the <font color="LEVEL">Dark Cloud Mansion</font>.<br>
They say that a monster named <font color="LEVEL">Baylor</font> rules over the <font color="LEVEL">Water Dragon's Cave</font>.<br>
I believe that Baylor guards the place where the Shamaness is being held captive.<Br>
If that is the case, you will only be able reach the Shamaness is being defeating Baylor.<br>
That creature is said to be far stronger and more frightening than ordinary monsters, so please be careful...<br>
