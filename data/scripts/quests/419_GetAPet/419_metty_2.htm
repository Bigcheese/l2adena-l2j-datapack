So, you want to learn about the pets? Good, I will teach you everything I know.<br>
First of all, the wolf. This is the first pet that you will breed. A wolf's sence of smell can detect an object as far as<font color="LEVEL"> 2.4 km</font> away. They hunt in packs of 7-14 with a <font color="LEVEL">male</font> leader.<br>
Fully grown they are no larger than a man, and can be distinguished from dogs by their drooping tails.<br>
There are also many kinds f wild wolves in Aden, and they vary from region to region. Around here you will find Dire wolves, the oldest and most primitive type. In Elmore, to the far north, there are Kasha Wolves in Orc Country and Black Wolves in the Dwarf lands.
