Wrong! You have failed the test. I am so sorry for you...
You have tried so hard to make it up to here...<br>
I shall give you one more chance to take the test again. 
Of course not just like this.<font color="LEVEL"> You'll 
have to meet the animal lovers association members once 
again and take some lessons from them.</font> 
Then, I shall give you another chance to take the test.</body></html>
