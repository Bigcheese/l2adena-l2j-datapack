Let's see...
There are so many of them...<br>Oh, I just remembered 
that you were a Dwarf! In that case, I would like you 
to go to your hometown and get rid of the animal slaughters 
there. How does that sound? That doesn't seem too hard for you, 
is it?<br>When you go to the Spine Mountains Mining Zone of your 
hometown, you'll find<font color="LEVEL"> the hunter tarantula, 
and plunder tarantula</font>. You can call them the most wicked 
animal slaughterers in the Spine Mining Zone. 
They say that they devour the animals every day. There are hardly 
any animals left near where they live.<br>Therefore you should 
go and get rid of them. By the way, when you return, you should 
bring some kind of proof that you killed the monsters. How could 
I possibly trust you if you come back with nothing to prove your 
victory? Now, if everything is clear, be off!</body></html>
