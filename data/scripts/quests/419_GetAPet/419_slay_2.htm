Let's see...There are so many of them...<br>
Oh, I just remembered that you were a Dark Elf. In that case, 
I would like you to go to your hometown and get rid of the animal 
slaughters there. How does that sound? That doesn't seem too hard 
for you, is it?<br>If you go to the Dark Elven Forest, you'll be 
able to find<font color="LEVEL"> the lesser dark horror, dark horror, 
and the prowler</font>. They are the most wicked animal slaughterers 
in the Dark Elven Forest. They say that they devour the animals every 
day. There are hardly any animals left near where they live.<br>Therefore 
you should go and get rid of them. By the way, when you return, 
you should bring some kind of proof that you killed the monsters. 
How could I possibly trust you if you come back with nothing to prove 
your victory? Now, if everything is clear, be off!</body></html>
