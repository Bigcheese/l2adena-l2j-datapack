We know not... Perhaps we have been unfaithful. But we must win back Shilen's grace. Without it, we grow weaker with each passing season, sickening like a tree deprived of sunlight. Even the dinosaurs we once commanded turn on us, tearing our people to pieces!<br>
Outsider, if you are willing to help us to earn back the grace of Shilen, would you donate <font color="LEVEL">Plain Dinosaur Bones</font>? If so, I will give you ingredients to make your weapons. On the other hand, if you can help us to make a medicine to cure this illness, I will give you the recipe you need to make your weapons.<br>
