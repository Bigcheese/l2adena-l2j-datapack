We need a certain number of Plain Dinosaur Bones to make the medicine we need. This may only be a matter of profit for you, but to us it's a matter of survival! There's no room to bergain. Unless you bring me the exact number we need, we will not reward you.<br>
So hurry and hunt <font color="LEVEL">Deinonychus, Ornithomimus, Pakikepalosaurus and Wild Striders</font> and bring me the number of <font color="LEVEL">Plain Dinosaur Bones</font> I asked for!
