Thank you, adventurer.<br>
I think I can make a good medicine with the bones you gave me. Now we can stay alive a little longer...<br>
(Despite his words, Karakawei seems depressed.)<br>
Take it as a token of our tribe's appreciation. And please bring more Plain Dinosaur Bones so we can make even more medicine.
