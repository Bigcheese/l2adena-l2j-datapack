Do I sound suspicious? At one time, this village was renowned for its hospitality... But then, something terrible happened here... We've been very wary of strangers since that dark day!<br>
But recently, there have been promising signs... High Priest Sylvan is planning a small tea party after the Sunday worship service at the temple. Worshippers and visitors are all invited! Hopefully, this will bring our village back to life! I want to bake some pies for the party, but I'm out of honey. Could you help me?<br>
