They respect diversity...<br>
They claim that all powers and creatures are equal, and that the Temple and the Rulers of Dawn are simply trying to accumulate power and wealth for their own benefit.<br>

The Temple and the Rulers of Dawn have perpetuated that myth, they say, to maintain their hold on power.<br>
Both the Preachers and the Revolutionaries of Dusk are intent on finding iron-clad evidence of the Temple's hypocrisy that will sway the people to their side.<br>
