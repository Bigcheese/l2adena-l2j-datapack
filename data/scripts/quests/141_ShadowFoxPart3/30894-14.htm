<html><body>Warehouse Chief Natools:<br>
Our organization takes a neutral stance in any dispute over power or ideology, nor am I personally interested in those things.<br>
Normally we accept our missions based on the size of the payment.<br>
In this case, however, both sides have offered us the same amount...<br>
So I am giving this to you to decide.<br>Choose well -- our organization will abide by your decision.<br>
