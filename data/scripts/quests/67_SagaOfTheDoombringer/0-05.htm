<html><body>Hierarch Kekropus:<br>
I do not have the time to tell you everything now, but this at least you should know: We Kamael were not sealed on the Isle of Souls 
because of our combat prowess, as is generally believed, but rather to disguise our true identity and origin.<br>
A man in black armor and a woman in a blue dress -- I cannot say more about their identities than that -- ultimately released the seal 
to allow us back into the world in order to help oppose the growing power of Shilen and her followers.<br>
But though we may now venture onto the surface of the wide world, our true potential is still limited. Still, the woman promised to 
release those limitations when someone with the proper qualifications appeared.<br>
I believe that you may meet those qualifications: the ability to wield Enuma Elish, the sword that can divide heaven and earth. Will you 
attempt to unbind your sealed power?<br>
