Have you seen the Lienrik near Heine? Oh, they're so beautiful... I must have one!<br>
Just imagine it. They fly, so they don't get dirty...and those marvelous colors! And their skin feels cool and moist, like a delicious mug of ale on a hot summer day.<br>
Warm and furry pets are pass√© these days. A Lienrik is much more unique.<br>
