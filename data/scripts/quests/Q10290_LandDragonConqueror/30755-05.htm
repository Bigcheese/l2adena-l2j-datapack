<html><body>Antharas Watchman Theodric:<br>
I am a Watcher which brings the curse of immortality. My purpose in life is to watch over the earth dragon, Antharas. I can only assume that you and your comrades are here to slay the dragon.<br>
I wish to give you some words of wisdom before you venture into this cave... <br>
You will die.<br>
