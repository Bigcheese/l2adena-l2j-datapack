If you want to know about the second level of the trial, go and meet<font color="LEVEL">  Sir Kiel Knighthawk</font>. He is in the<font color="LEVEL"> Dark Elven Guild of Dion Castle Town</font>. By all means I hope that you complete the rest of your tasks successfully. I shall pray to Einhasad for your brilliance.
