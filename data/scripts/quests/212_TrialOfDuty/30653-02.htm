I know it is not an easy task. But it is a necessary job for you to do, in order to acquire brilliance. Make an end to the<font color="LEVEL"> Spirits of Harrod</font> with the rusty sword I gave you, and free him from his disgraceful curse. As you terminate the<font color="LEVEL"> undead skulls wandering around the Wastelands</font> one by one, you'll be able to confront him in the end.
