<html><body>Sir Aaron Tanford:<br>
One of the virtues that define a Knight's brilliance is<font color="LEVEL"> dignity</font>. But the meaning of dignity differs from person to person...<br>
Right now, some group of gangs who knows nothing about dignity settled down in this Wastelands, and are disturbing the people around the area. By that I mean<font color="LEVEL"> Harrod and his perpetrators,</font> who was once a prestigious Knight of Gludio.<br>
At the time with war against Grecia, Harrod was allured by the enemy's leader. So he betrayed us and became the agent of the invaders. Sir Klaus Vasper who couldn't forgive his betrayal, chased after him tenaciously until he finally stuck in a spear into his heart. Karol said that 'A knight who abandoned his dignity is as good as dead' and without even holding a funeral, he dumped his body in the Wastelands.<br>
Even God seemed to disapprove of his rest, so he had no peace even dead. The once-prestigious Knight had been degraded into a cursed devil.<br>
Perhaps the only thing that can free him from the curse is this rusted Knight sword.<font color="LEVEL"> The undead skulls which are wondering around the Wasteland</font> are his perpetrators. As you terminate the filthy undead skulls one by one, you'll be able to confront the<font color="LEVEL"> Spirit of Harrod </font> in the end. Kill him with the sword I gave you, and remind him of the noble dignity of a Gludio Knight. If possible, please bring something that he left as he died.
