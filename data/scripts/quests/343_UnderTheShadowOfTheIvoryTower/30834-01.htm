Have you heard of nebulite? It is a mineral often found in meteorites. Processed properly, even a tiny amount can produce tremendous energy. It is quite valuable to those who seek to amplify magical power.<br>
The Dwarves say that nebulite was used by the Titans as their primary source of energy. At that time the mineral was abundant, but the expansion of the titan civilization exhausted most of the precious material. Nowadays it is quite rare, and can only be found in a few places...<br>
