Will you join our research? We are investigating the use of nebulite for the greater public good. However, we are having a hard time finding nebulite for our study. The Dwarven collectors we hired for this task have not been heard from in over a month.<br>
Would you do this work for us? Around the crater of the Ivory Tower you will find<font color="LEVEL"> manashen gargoyles, enchanted monster eyes, enchanted stone golems</font>, and enchanted iron golems. They have fallen under the spell of the<font color="LEVEL"> Nebulite Orbs</font>, which are fragments of the meteorite. If you kill these monsters you can easily collect the nebulite samples we need for our research.<br>
You shall be well-compensated for your efforts.<br>
