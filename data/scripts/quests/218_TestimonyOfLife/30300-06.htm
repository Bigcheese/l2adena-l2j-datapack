<html><body>Blacksmith Pushkin:<br>
First I will need a very pure, specially-made varnish to refine pure Mithril. Using normal varnish to refine pure Mithril will destroy it. This special varnish is derived from the secretions of giant ants.<br>
You will find these ants in the Wastelands of Gludio. There are hundreds of giant ants in the underground there... Kill only<font color="LEVEL"> ant soldiers</font> and collect the<font color="LEVEL"> liquid from their body</font> in a bottle. 20 bottles will be enough.<br>
And last, we will need<font color="LEVEL"> wyrm claws</font>. Carving a Mithril surface requires a strong and sharp knife, normal knives and chisels are not suitable. I need a chisel made from wyrm claws. Please get me 20 unbroken claws.<br>
So, the 3 materials we need are: Pure Mithril ore, ant soldier liquid and wyrm claws. You can remember all this, right? Good luck, Elf!
