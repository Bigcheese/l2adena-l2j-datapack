May the blessings of the starlight be with you. You have recovered Talin's Spear! Thank you so much for your trouble.<br>
Now that we both have the<font color="LEVEL"> Grail of Purity</font> and the<font color="LEVEL"> Talin's Spear</font> we can set off in search for the Water of Life. But it is impossible without the biggest sacrifice and the greatest sorrow...<br>
We must pierce the<font color="LEVEL"> Unicorn of Eva</font> which can be called the guardian of our forest with the Talin's Spear and collect its<font color="LEVEL"> tears</font> in the Grail of Purity. That is the 'Water of Life' itself. After all, in order to recover the life of the Mother Tree, we must deprive the life of our dearest Eva's incarnation, the unicorn...<br>
Now do you see what you have to do? May the Goddess forgive us for our deed...
