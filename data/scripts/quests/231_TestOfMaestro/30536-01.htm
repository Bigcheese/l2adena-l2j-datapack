The products of the Black Anvil Guild are considered the cutting edge of Dwarven technology. We are responsible for the renaissance of the ancient giants' technology. If I become guild master, I intend to double the pace of our technological development, and Dwarves will take a new place among the races...<br>
So, you want a letter of recommendation. Such things do not come freely.<br>
A mobile teleport device developed by our guild was recently stolen. We suspect Master Toma, but our guild cannot investigate directly. Meet Master Toma to find out if he has the device. If he does, get it from him and return it to me. I can show you where he is on the map you have with you... We will talk about the recommendation letter afterwards.
