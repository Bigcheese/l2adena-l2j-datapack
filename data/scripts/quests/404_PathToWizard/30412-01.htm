Wind Sylph:<br>
I see you have come to find the token of wind. The winds blowing here told me of your story. If you grant me one favor, I will happily give you the token of wind.<br>
Not long ago,<font color="LEVEL"> the wastelands lizardman</font> appeared in the southwest Wastelands, and it has been so noisy ever since that I haven't been able to savor the wind comfortably.<br>
<font color="LEVEL">Please make the wastelands lizardman quiet so my meditations are not disrupted. Then I will give you the token of wind.</font>
