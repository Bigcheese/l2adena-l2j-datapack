Actually, I had asked a Dwarven Artisan to craft a certain tool I require for my magic experiment.<br>
He sent back a list of ingredients that he needs to craft it.<br>
Although I have managed to obtain most of the materials on his list, I have had no luck 
procuring any Enmity Crystals.<br>
Plase go to <font color="LEVEL">Floran Village,</font> hunt the <font color="LEVEL">Watchman of the 
Plains, the Roughly-Hewen Rock Golem, the Delu Lizardman Supplier, the Delu Lizardman Special 
Agent, the Cursed Seer, the Delu Lizardman Commander and the Delu Lizardman Shaman,</font> 
and bring back <font color="LEVEL">30 Enmity Crystals.</font>
