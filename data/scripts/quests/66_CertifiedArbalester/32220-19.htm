<html><body>Master Selsia:<br>
Eliminate the Crimson Lady and retrieve the Giants' Research Documents.<br>
We must not allow secrets concerning our race to fall into other hands.<br>
The <font color="LEVEL">Crimson Lady is being guarded by Timak Orc Soldiers and Timak Orc 
Archers at the Timak Outpost.</font><br>
Slay the <font color="LEVEL">Timak Orc Soldiers and Timak Orc Archers</font> and 
you will no doubt find her.<br>
This is not an easy task, but I believe in you...<br>
Good luck to you!
