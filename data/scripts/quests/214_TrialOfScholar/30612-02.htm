So, you have come to find the 4th volume of the Scripture of Knowledge? I understand your situation but it is not something that I can give out so easily. Do you know what the significance of this Scripture is? It is that it contains all the knowledge in this world.<br>
Perhaps it might even include all the knowledge and techniques of the Giants which was thought to have disappeared from this world! The absolute geometry... Ah, I guess you don't know about the absolute geometry. It's a pity that we can't know the contents in detail since we are missing volumes 1, 2, and 3...<br>
