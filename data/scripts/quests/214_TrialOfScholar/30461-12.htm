At the last step, you'll have to meet<font color="LEVEL">  Wiseman Cronos</font> He is known as the wise prophet and the greatest scholar of all times. Nobody know his real name or how old he is. There are rumors that he was even alive in the age of Elmoraden. The history book also mentions his name several times.<br>
Certain people dare to call him a swindler, but I have met him during my days of discipline and as I see it, he is the true prophet.<br>
Nowadays, he is secluding himself in the<font color="LEVEL"> Hunters' Village.</font> He usually lives a secluded life from the world, but from time to time he joins us in the trial in the hope of meeting some young scholars.<br>
Take this mark with you and see Cronos the Wise. Accomplishing the task that he gives you is the final step of the trial.
