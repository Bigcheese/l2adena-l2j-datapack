You clumsy man. You should find that out for yourself! If you have completely no idea, I will give you a clue. Go and meet this guy called<font color="LEVEL">  Dieter</font> from the<font color="LEVEL"> Sorcerers' Guild in Giran</font>. He used to be one of my servants... Anyway, I suppose you'll be able to get some advice from him. Don't lose time! Take this mark and letter in case he refuses to meet a greenhorn like you !
