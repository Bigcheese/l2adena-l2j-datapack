This is the picture that Creta drew for you? Hmm... Look over here! There is a strange shadow. Does this mean that this is the figure of the thief? But I can hardly tell who is who. By its appearance, it seems that he's not a human...<br>
Why don't we rather show it to<font color="LEVEL"> Captain Lucas</font>? I think he'll be able to distinguish who's figure it is, since he is an expert in this field.
