Good! You are a cool guy. Then listen to me carefully. I heard that there was a very precious crystal. What was its name, yes that's right<font color="LEVEL"> the Crystal of Purity</font>. I heard that only one person can make it.<br>
If you can bring me one of those, I shall gladly give you that Scripture of Knowledge or whatever.
