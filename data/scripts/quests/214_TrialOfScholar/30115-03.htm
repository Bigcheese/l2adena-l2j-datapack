Good. First, take this mark. Now I will tell you about the monsters you must investigate. First is the<font color="LEVEL"> Monster Eye Destroyer</font>. You must bring me 5 of the Monster Eye Destroyer's Skins.<br>
Second is the<font color="LEVEL"> Breka Orc Shaman</font>. They can be easily found in Giran. Destroy them and bring back 5 of the Shaman Necklaces.<br>
Last of all is the monster called<font color="LEVEL"> Shackle</font>. I need 2 Shackle Scalps. They lurk about the Valley of Dragons, but you must be careful in facing them. Your life may be in danger, so please be careful. It may not be easy to remember all of these, so let me write you a list.
