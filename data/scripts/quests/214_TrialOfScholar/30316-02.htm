What? Weren't you here in search for the Scripture of Knowledge? In fact I have been suffering from nightmares for the last couple of days. Every night in my dreams an old man appeared and threatened me to give the scripture to the person who brings this envelope. First I thought it was just a silly dream, but then the same thing happen every night for a whole week... I was so frightened and anxious...<br>
Anyway, I truly apologize. Here I will give you the<font color="LEVEL"> Scripture of Knowledge: Volume I</font>. But about the remaining 3 volumes, I do not know. My brother said that he shared it with his friends. I heard that some strange man asked them to steal the scriptures... However my brother and his young fellows enticed it from him again. And ran all the way to this village where I live. Afterwards they separated with one book each, and since then they lost contact.<br>
What do you say, would you like to meet<font color="LEVEL"> my brother</font>? Perhaps he might remember something. By the way, he won't even try to speak to you if you don't bring him any alcohol, so here, take this wine with you. I hope you sort it out so that I can sleep in peace now.<br>
