The absolute geometry was made a long time ago, around the era of myths. It contained every truth in this world. Mathematics, dynamics, architecture, astronomy, and navigation were all derived from the absolute geometry. So they say that he who understands the absolute geometry, can get hold of the world's power.<br>
This absolute geometry is written down in<font color="LEVEL"> Maphr's Tablet Fragment</font> with the Giant's characters. I heard that the Dwarves are struggling to obtain the tablet these days...but I am afraid of the consequences it will bring if they are handed to such greedy creatures.<br>
The Scripture of Knowledge is the book of absolute geometry written down in easy words. What do you think will become of it once they are in the hands of disqualified people? That is why I asked you to bring it back. After all it was only a part that I wrote... And with only 4 of them they'll never be able to find anything out... But just in case... Anyway, good job!
