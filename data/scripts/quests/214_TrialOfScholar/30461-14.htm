You have brought the Mark of Cronos! Didn't you have any difficulties? I was a bit worried since he is a naughty man. Don't take me wrong. I didn't mean anything bad.<br>
Now you have completely passed the Scholar's Trial! Congratulations! You have approached a higher level of knowledge and comprehension. I will give you the<font color="LEVEL"> Trial of the Scholar</font>. You will need it once you are trying to promote to a higher wizard. May Goddess bless you in your future. Bye.
