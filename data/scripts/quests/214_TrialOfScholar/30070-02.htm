While you are carrying out my task, keep this mark with you. Let's start purifying the doomed land of the execution ground. To do so, we need the<font color="LEVEL"> Crystal of Purity</font>. It is a crystal made out of pure formations without any substances added into it.<br>
But this 100 percent pure gem cannot be obtained easily. The only person who can make it is<font color="LEVEL"> the one and only, Maria</font> in this village. Meet her with this letter I give you. She will tell you more specifically about the Crystal of Purity.
