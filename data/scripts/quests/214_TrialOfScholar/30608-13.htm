What! You have torn the scrolls! That's beyond my understanding.<br>
But it seems that at least we'll be able to read what's written on it if we put all the parts together. We're lucky.<br>
Now I shall begin making the crystal. The crystal that I make shall purify this land... What an irony. I will open Maria's Crystal Workshop once again!<br>
I will give the first made crystal to you. Please wait for a moment, it won't take long.<br>
