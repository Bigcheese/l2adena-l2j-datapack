<html><body>Magister Mirien:<br>
<font color="LEVEL">The Trial of Scholar</font> is a kind of test that all Wizards must go through. Only those Wizards who have the passion for research and humbleness in learning will pass the test and be handed down the high magic and knowledge.<br>
But I see that you are not the kind of person involved in research. Every person has their own way. For some, it could be the mission as a Warrior, and for others it could be seeking the divine providence of God and contemplating on it. I hope that you will faithfully walk your own road and wisely overcome the obstacles that you confront along the way.<br>
(Quest available only for Wizards or Elven Wizards above Level 35 )
