How on earth...! Until now, I thought there were only 4 volumes of Scripture of Knowledge... But oh my God! It says that there is one before the 1st volume and one after the 4th...! How could it be...! Without the two, we won't be able to understand the Scripture completely! I can't believe that even after finding the 4 volumes, I won't be able to decipher the meanings...
