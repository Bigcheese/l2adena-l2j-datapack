What did you just say? Did you say that you have the rest of the Scripture? Is that true?<br>
Hmm...OK But instead give me sometime so that I can make a copy of every volume. It won't take too long, since we will use magic instead of writing it down by hand. We need some special materials for it, though. It is something that is too hard for me to acquire... Will you help me?<br>
