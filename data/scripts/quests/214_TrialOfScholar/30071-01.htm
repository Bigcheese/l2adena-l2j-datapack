Maria's scroll... I heard that it was a very important thing. We've been searching everywhere but still there is no trace of it. The criminal must be a very thorough one.<br>
Nothing turned up for a whole month! Phew...should we go see a fortune-teller just in case?...<br>
Anyway<font color="LEVEL"> please tell Maria that I am terribly sorry</font>. It won't take too long. I'll be sure to catch the criminals one of these days.
