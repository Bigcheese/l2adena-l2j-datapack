<html><body>High Priest Sylvain:<br>
You have brought it. The Crystal of Purity made out of the purist formations!<br>
To tell the truth, I already knew that she couldn't make the crystal. But I wanted you to help her find the way out in making the crystal. Thanks to you, the precious knowledge has been restored once again as well as acquiring the crystal which is essential for carrying out the purification job. Good work.<br>
I will give you the mark as I had promised. Take this to<font color="LEVEL"> Magister Mirien</font> standing over there. I wish you good results in the Trial of the Scholar.
