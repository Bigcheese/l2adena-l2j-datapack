<html><body>Guard Belton:<br>
I lost my entire family to<font color="LEVEL"> the dragon Antaras</font>. Ten years ago, my mother and sister were killed when many of the villages in Southern Giran were destroyed by Antaras, and three years ago, when a company was formed by the lord's orders to slay the dragon, my father and brother were drafted as soldiers and sent to the Valley of Dragons, where they met their death.<br>
I swore on the graves of my family that I would slay the great monster. Everyone tells me it is useless, but I will slay Antaras one day. Surely that is the only way my family's souls will be put to rest?<br>
I have prepared for revenge for the last year. I have sought the advice of many warriors, and researched documents related to dragons in the library of the Ivory Tower. The famous Dwarf Master Raider Terrin Wyrmslayer, reknowned as a dragon hunter, was especially helpful with his advice. Eventually, I decided that the most effective weapon would be an<font color="LEVEL"> arrow</font>.<br>
For the last six months, I have daily sworn revenge as I created arrows that will kill Antaras. But because the materials for the arrows are hard to find, I often ask travellers like you to gather materials for me. I may have to ask you this favor sometime.<br>
