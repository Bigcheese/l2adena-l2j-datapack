<html><body>Bounty Hunter Kintaijin:<br>
When used on a Bizarre Cocoon, the Growth Accelerator will spawn a Cannibalistic Stakato Chief. And killing a chief will give you a Stakato Cocoon. And as we all know, Stakato Cocoona can hold different kinds of goodies - from Forgotten Scrolls to Icarus recipes! Although sometimes you are bound to get one that contains nothing at all.<br>
But heed this advice - do not try to take down one of these Cannibalistic Stakato Chiefs by yourself. They are very strong and very deadly. And it will take a party of your friends or clanmates to defeat these termagants.
