1, 2, 3... 10! Yes you have found all 10 of them. Ha ha...with this I shall be able to proceed one step further in my plans. Good!<br>
Hmm... Ah, never mind about what I said just now. I was just talking to myself. Good, I now know that you have enough capacity. I shall give you the information you wanted now. While you were out hunting, I was also busy conducting research.<br>
This bezoar is the so-called 'Abyss Runestone'. It must be related to Shilen, the Goddess of Abyss. How do I know? That is because when you flash a certain wavelength of light, the emanation which occurs due to the refraction-dispersion makes a typical distribution of Ruper's curve. If you magnify the pattern ~(abridged)~ apply the Magnus' constant, compare it by Bernu's analysis, you can find a shape similar to the Shilen's pattern between the 8th and the 9th diagram... What does this mean? It means that this bezoar is related to Shilen. Anyway, you won't be able to understand better even though I explain further.<br>
However, there is one problem.<br>
