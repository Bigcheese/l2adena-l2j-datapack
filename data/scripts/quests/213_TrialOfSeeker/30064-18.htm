I think you are sufficiently prepared now. I will tell you about the next task. Being contaminated by a Dark Bezoar is something to worry about; however, according to Marina's research, the contamination seems to be limited to only a few creatures. I want you to be in charge of getting rid of those hosts.<br>
<font color="LEVEL">Marsh Stakato Drones</font>,<font color="LEVEL"> Breka Orc Overlords</font>,<font color="LEVEL"> Noble Ant Captains</font>, and<font color="LEVEL"> Leto Lizardman Warriors</font> are the monsters on the list. Of course, these creatures all have<font color="LEVEL"> tendencies to be aggressive</font>. Extract the Dark Bezoars from their bodies.<br>
Do you know where you can find them?<br>
