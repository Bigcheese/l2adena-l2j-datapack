Since there is no time, I don't think it is a good idea to search for them randomly. Listen carefully.<br>
First, the Ol Mahum Captain can be found<font color="LEVEL"> near the Partisan's Hideaway</font> in the north-east.<br>
The next place is Gludin Village, which is a bit far from here. I guess you can clearly see now, that these mutations sprang out from several places around the world. You will be able to meet the Turek Orc Warldord at the<font color="LEVEL"> Orc Barracks</font> in the northern part of Gludin Village.<br>
I bet you have been to the<font color="LEVEL"> Wastelands</font> of Gludio before? It is where there are a lot of huge insects... Find the Ant Captain there. You'll be able to find him better in the underground<font color="LEVEL"> Ant's Nest</font> rather than the Wastelands above. But the Ant's Nest is an extremely dangerous place so you'd better not go in there alone.<br>
And last, the most dangerous of them all... Have you ever seen the so-called Turek bugbears while you where traveling around<font color="LEVEL"> Giran</font>? Turek bugbear Warrior are the leaders among the beasts.<br>
Now then, let's get on with the work. You go there now. I shall follow you soon after..
