Is the investigation going well? We don't have much time so you'd better hurry. Do you remember who you should catch? They are<font color="LEVEL"> Ol Mahum Captains</font>,<font color="LEVEL"> Turek Orc Warlords</font>,<font color="LEVEL"> Ant Captain</font>, and<font color="LEVEL"> Turek Bugbear Warrior</font>...
