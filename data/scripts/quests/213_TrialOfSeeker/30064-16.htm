I suppose you already know that those creatures who possess an Abyss Runestone within them have exceptional intelligence? The matter would not be so bad if that's all there was to it, but another problem is that these creatures are extremely hostile towards the Elves, Dark Elves, Orcs, and Dwarves, as well as the Humans. Do you understand? Why those creatures have become so aggressive?... They are clever creatures so they will surely take control over their kind, and imagine what will happen when they incite the others?<br>
Also, this incident has something to do with the Goddess Shilen. The dark powers of Shilen are the origin of the Dark Bezoars... Or to put it another way, it has been proven by experiment that Shilen's power is behind this incident. ...It is said that she who is the Goddess of Darkness, as well as the original Goddess of Water, left the other Gods and went to the east, where she created all sorts of magic creatures. It is a serious matter indeed that many years have since passed, but it is only now that Shilen's powers are being detected from the monsters.<br>
The most dangerous conclusion from this experiment is that the Dark Bezoar is contagious. Moreover, according to Marina's experiment, this is an artificial stone, not a natural occurrence.<br>
From now on, you and I must throw ourselves into even more dangerous and difficult tasks. I'll do my part, but you also must carry out your role. I hope you are not about to leave me hanging, after getting me into this?<br>
