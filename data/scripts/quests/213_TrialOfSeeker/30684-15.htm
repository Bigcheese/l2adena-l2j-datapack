The appearing of the pattern is very irregular. The probabilities are random and its conditions are still a mystery. Moreover, I don't get why the bezoar could only be found in the body of an aggressive monster. It seems that we'll have to send it to Marina to know about it more specifically...<br>
Ah, she is a<font color="LEVEL"> woman who works as a Magister in the Ivory Tower of Oren</font>. She is an acquaintance of mine. If you want to know more in detail, you'd better go and meet her. I shall give you a written request for analysis where I included my results on the research of the bezoar. Take it to Magister Marina of the Ivory Tower. She is an expert in this area.
