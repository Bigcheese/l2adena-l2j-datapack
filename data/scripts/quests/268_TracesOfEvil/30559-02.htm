I appreciate your willingness to help our Duda-Mara tribe. There is much to do, so I will tell you about the mission without further delay.<br>
To discover the reason for this disaster, we require a medium. Once the Kasha Spider was our sacred symbol, and even though it has now been corrupted by this fiend, it will still be a suitable medium.<br>
You can find the spiders in the <font color="LEVEL">north of the Immortal Plateau</font>. Take the lives of the <font color="LEVEL">Kasha Spider, Kasha Fang Spider and Kasha Blade Spider</font> and bring us <font color="LEVEL">30 Contaminated Kasha Spider Venom samples</font>. Then I will be able to determine the source of the evil fiend Kasha through this medium. <br>Of course your service in this matter will be rewarded...
