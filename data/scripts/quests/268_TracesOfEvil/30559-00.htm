Ah... Do you also know about the <font color="LEVEL">Fiend Kasha, who causes corruption and death</font>? <br>
I know your valor, but I warn you that this mission will not be without great risk. Unless you are ready in body and soul, I fear you will be overwhelmed. Naturally that also means failure for our cause. <br>
In my assessment, your strength is far too inadequate to undertake this mission. Focus on your training! <br>
(Only characters who are level 15 and above may undertake this quest.)
