Captain Bezique:<br>
I see that you have received the horseshoe of light from Neti. It seems that she perceives some talent within you. You must be more skilled than you look. Very well then, it's time to become serious about stopping these thieves. This is<font color="LEVEL"> a wanted poster</font>.<br>
If you look at the poster, you can see that your targets call themselves<font color="LEVEL"> the Cat's Eye bandits</font>. All of them are of the ol mahum race, and apparently their leader's nickname is Cat's Eye. According to the reports received from my men, who I sent out on a scout mission, their headquarters are near<font color="LEVEL"> the abandoned camp</font>, where the remaining ol mahum forces often gather. If you don't know how to get there, ask Guard Praga.<br>
<font color="LEVEL">Use the bow and dagger that Neti gave you to get rid of the Cat's Eye bandits once and for all. And be sure to bring back the four items that were stolen from the villagers.</font> I think you'll agree that this is a worthy test of your skills? May the gods grant you victory!
