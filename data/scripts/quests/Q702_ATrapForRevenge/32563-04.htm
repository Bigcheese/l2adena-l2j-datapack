Good! But don't expect this to be easy. Its spirit is so strong that it doesn't succumb to the power of the Seed. Many have promised to hunt them, but few have succeeded. Most are killed or seriously wounded in the attempt.<br>
But you look like the type who likes a challenge, eh? I'd recommend that you go see <font color="LEVEL">Soldier Tenius</font> near the center of <font color="LEVEL">Keucereus Alliance Base</font> before leaving. He was injured while hunting <font color="LEVEL">Dius</font>. Nobody knows more about this monster than he does.
