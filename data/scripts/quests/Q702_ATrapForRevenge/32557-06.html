Here! It's finished. It radiates intense energy now that the blood energy has been added to the original energy of the Red Star Stone Extraction Stones. You should be able to use it to lure out Dius, the Messenger of Destruction.<br>
Do you know how to use it? Find some <font color="LEVEL">Baby Drake Wings</font> and cover them with it. Hopefully that will make Dius believe that his young are being attacked and he will become enraged. Be careful -- he will be very dangerous at that point. But this tactic should exploit the Dragonkins' instinct to protect their own kind.<br>
I'm sure Tenis already told you that <font color="LEVEL">Dius will appear only when the Seed of Destruction becomes stable</font>. This bait will be useless if you use it at any other time.<br>
Good luck!
