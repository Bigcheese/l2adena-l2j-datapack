Excellent! As a Kamael, you should know the truth of what I am about to tell you.<br>
Seek the Statue of History within the Nornil's Cave. Know that it is more than it appears. It is a kind of terminal to allow you to communicate with another. Do this and you will discover the key to unlock the secret you seek.<br>
To communicate with the statue, use the password: CRTR. Good luck!
