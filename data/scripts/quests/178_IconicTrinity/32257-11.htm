%playername%: If the Isle of Souls was hidden to avoid discovery, why would it be revealed now?<br>
N: That is a mystery. Perhaps the original reason for hiding the island is no longer necessary -- or perhaps there is an even more compelling reason to risk unsealing the island.<br>
I wonder how the Kamael will cope with this sudden change...  I suppose that will be decided by how well and wisely you young people act. It is far past time for you to take ownership of your own destiny as a race.<br>
I can tell you nothing more; return to Kekropus. Farewell! <br>
