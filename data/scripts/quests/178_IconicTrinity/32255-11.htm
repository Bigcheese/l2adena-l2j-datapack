N: You know, of course, that the Kamael do not serve the gods as do the other races, who generally serve the god or goddess who created them. In this way, the Elves serve Eva, the Dark Elves serve Shilen, the Dwarves serve Maphr, the Orcs serve Pa'agrio, and the Humans serve Einhasad. Only we serve no god...<br>
Does that not seem somewhat unnatural? If one of those gods or goddesses created us, why do we not worship him or her? Who is our true creator? <br>
