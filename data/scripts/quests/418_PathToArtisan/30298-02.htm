<html><body>Blacksmith Pinter:<br>
Actually, Kluto asked me for something before... I kept it hidden in the corner of the blacksmith's shop for a long time, but oh dear, the item has been stolen! If I don't have it, Kluto will be terribly angry... he may seem like a gentleman but he has a temper like fire. When he is angry, not even the head blacksmiths can calm him. How will I find that item?<br>
