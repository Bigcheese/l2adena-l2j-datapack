Excellent! Visit either of the 2 Kamalokas we can enter from Gludio, kill the Kaneus there and extract their cellular tissues. <br>
You will face the <font color="LEVEL">Tomlan Kamos and Ol Ariosh</font> Kaneus. The Tomlan Kamos is much weaker, so I'd advise that you pursue it first. <br>
When you have extracted all the cellular tissues of the 2 creatures, take them to <font color="LEVEL">Magister Rohmer</font> at the Temple of Einhasad. I know he and the other Sages will appreciate your efforts.<br>
Good hunting!
