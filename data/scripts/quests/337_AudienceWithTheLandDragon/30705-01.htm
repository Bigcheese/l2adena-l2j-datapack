An Angel feather?! That means Gabrielle sent you! Then you want to challenge the Land Dragon, right? Hai Orkrun!<br>
Your courage is a credit to our race. We'll see, though, if your skills match your guts! Go to the <font color="LEVEL">Forsaken Plains</font> and kill some <font color="LEVEL">Kranrot and Hamrut</font>, then bring me a proof!<br>
If you can't do that, Antharas won't even need to kill you--his visage alone would kill you on the spot!
