<html><body>Warehouse Chief Moke:<br>
An abyss jewel is used to focus the power of dark magic into one place. 
The followers of Antharas are attempting to breach the force field that binds 
their master. If they are successful it will mean the end of us all. 
No more tomorrows! We must destroy the abyss jewel as soon as we can!<br>
It is located on the <font color="LEVEL">Windy Hill north of Gludin</font>. 
You must hurry there  with your comrades and dash the jewel to bits.<br>
You must beware. Dark spirits guard the abyss jewel. They will attack and try 
to stop you. You must kill them all. If any are allowed to survive they 
could reconstitute the jewel.<br>
You have your assignment. Bring me a <font color="LEVEL">fragment of the abyss 
jewel</font> and <font color="LEVEL">proof that you have slain a jewel 
guardian</font>. When you bring these things to me I will give you my 
Mark of Watchman.</body></html>
