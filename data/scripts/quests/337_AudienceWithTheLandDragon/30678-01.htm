At last, someone sent by Gabrielle.<br>
I belong to the Black Anvil Guild but originally trained as a seal guardian 
under Gray Pillar's Filaur of the Gray Pillar Guild. You may not know this, but 
recently a decisive battle was fought between our brave warriors and the 
succubus gang. This gang is trying to free Antharas, the Land Dragon that is 
imprisoned by an underground aura in the Spine Mine region. One of our allies, 
Tuwang Raldo, managed to delay their evil plan, but Antharas's group escaped 
and is plotting once again to free the beast.<br>
They are attempting to use an <font color="LEVEL">Abyss Jewel</font> to destroy 
the aura that restrains the Land Dragon.<br>
