Now I can get started making Heavy Armor. I'll need some D-Grade crystals , but I know better than to ask a lightweight like you to bring them to me!<br>
Have your<font color="LEVEL"> Sponsor</font> bring me<font color="LEVEL"> 922 D-Grade Crystals</font>. Stop whining! I'm not running a charity here!<br>
Oh, by the way...<font color="LEVEL"> You've got to come back with your Sponsor!</font> How else would I know who your sponsor was?</body></html>
