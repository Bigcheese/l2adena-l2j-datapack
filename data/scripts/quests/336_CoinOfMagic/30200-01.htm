<html><body>Guard Stan:<br>
I had my own reason to apply for the guard position. While I stand here on my guard duty, I have the chance to meet with people from all over the world, and this gives me the opportunity to collect rare coins. Heh heh heh<br>
By the way, what would you like to trade with? These are all the coins I have... Also if you would like to trade with me, you will need<font color="LEVEL"> Blood Werewolf, Blood Drevanul, Gold knight, Gold Drake, Silver Golem or Silver Fairy</font>. Make your choice from what I have.<br>
