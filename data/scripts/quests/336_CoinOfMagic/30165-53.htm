You already knew about this game didn't you? This is the kind of game dwarves would come up with. Oh well... I decide on the 3 coins' color and order and you will have to guess their color and order. You have to come up with a correct answer within a certain number of times... Each time, I will let you know how many correct answers you came up with... You can use this as a hint... to guess the correct answer. You understand, right?<br>
