<html><body>Warehouse Keeper Hagger:<br>
This game was my idea. There was another one like it before, but the original concept was mine. I really didn't know that it would continue like this until now. OK, in this game, I'll set an order for three coins and hide them. You will guess the colors of the coins... one, two, three. Then I will tell you how many of them you got right. After repeating the questions and answers a set number of times, you have to guess the order of the hidden coins. Easy, no?<br>
