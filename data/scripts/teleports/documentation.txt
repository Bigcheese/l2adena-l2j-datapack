jscript/teleports is used for definitions of teleports that are too advanced to be done under normal means.
For example, teleporting to the race track allows a player a free teleport and a free return to the SAME
city from which the player went to the race track.  Normal teleports do not store any information about 
the origin.  In order to achieve this special teleportation, a teleport script is needed.

Teleport scripts are essentially dummy quests, hidden from the client.  All implementation details are
fully covered by quests.  For more info, please see the documentation in "scripts/quests/documentation.txt"
