<html><body>Grand Olympiad Operator:<br>
Grand Olympiad has the following rules.<br>
The Olympiad match can be generally divided by three types. One is a class-irrelevant-team match where 3 people become a team to compete with other teams, one is a class-irrelevant-individual match where 1:1 competition is held regardless of the class, one is a class-relevant-individual match where a person can compete with an opponent with the same class as his.<br>
To become a hero through Grand Olympiad, you have to win many Grand Olympiad matches. Winning goes to a team/an individual who inflicted the most damage to their opponent(s) in the Olympiad matches. Damage to a servitor of summoner, Golem of Maestro, or Dark Panther of Hell Knight will by no means affect the winning. The team with the 'most survived members' will win at a team match.<br>
The winner at Grand Olympiad will take some of the Olympiad points from the loser. In terms of calculating the Olympiad points, the winner takes 1/3 (1/5, in case of class-irrelevant-team or individual matches) of the least points after comparing the two total points, and the loser's points will be subtracted by as much as the winner takes. However, both teams' points will be subtracted by 1/5 from their own points in case of a tie.<br>
With a team match, 3 people will make up a team and only the party leader can apply for a match. All party members should have over 10 olympiad points in order to register for a team match. Addition/subtraction of points upon winning/losing will be calculated by adding every team members' points, and the loser's points will be partially subtracted.<br>
Added or deducted points due to win or lose is up to maximum 10 points for either an individual or team match.<br>
Appreciable amounts of Olympiad points will be given when the cycle of Olympiad starts and a small amount of points will be added at regular intervals. You can participate in an Olympiad match with at least 1 Olympiad point but you no longer participate in Grand Olympiad when the point is 0.<br>
