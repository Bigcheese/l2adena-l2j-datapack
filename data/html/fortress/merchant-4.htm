Knowing a fortress' layout can help your turn the 
battle to your advantage. Eacho fortress is 
essentially a residential area consisting of a 
large central command post surrounded by 
several barracks. 
<br>
There are 5 types of barracks: post barracks, 
archers barracks, support barracks, officer barracks 
and a control center. The number of barracks 
varies depending of the size of the fortress. 
Eacho barracks has a commander who must be 
defeated in order for you to conquer that 
barracks. Note that the control center must have 
a Warsmith in order to handle the machinery.
