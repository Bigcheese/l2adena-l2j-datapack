All right, listen carefully. There are 2 types of 
fortresses 
<br>
Territorial fortresses built within a specific 
territory to defend it from mosters attacks. There 
are also Border fortresses, which are built on the 
borders between two territories. If you have a  
map, take a look and you'll see what I mean. 
Blie flags indicate territorial forts, and red flags 
indicate border forts.
