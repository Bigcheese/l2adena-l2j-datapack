No one understands injustice better than I do. I know the rage you feel. I know from personal experience your consuming need for vengeance.<br>
Evil cannot be allowed to go unpunished! Revenge is not only desirable, it is necessary. To eradicate evil, those who commit evil acts must themselves be eliminated.<br>
Listen to your rage! Release it to become an instrument of justice!<br>
