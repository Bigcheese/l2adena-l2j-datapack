This Ivory Tower was nearly destroyed when the Elmoreden Empire fell. It survived not because of its power -- although the Ivory Tower had enough to control the continent -- but because its focus changed to become a pure research and educational institution.<br>
Some other magisters argue that we should restore our old power, but personally I think we are better off this way.<br>
