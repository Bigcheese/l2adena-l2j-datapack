Hmm? It's you? No... I'm currently doing research to make something new. And to do that, I need to meet new people. I feel like I've seen you before. <br>
If you aren't a new person, I can't have a new conversation. If I can't have a new conversation, I won't be able to think of something new. If I can't think of something new, I won't be able to make something new. Right? Yes, yes. Something new... Something new... <br>
Oh, was I saying something? Something new perhaps? Did you want something? <br>
