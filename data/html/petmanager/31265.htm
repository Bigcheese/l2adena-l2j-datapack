People too easily ignore the benefits Striders have provided to civilization. Think about it! Because of Striders, battle tactics for siege warfares and large-scale blood alliance wars have changed greatly. And transportation of goods between towns has become easier, helping accelerate the flow of trade.<br>
Perhaps I should write a book, eh? "The Impact of Striders on the History of the Continent." Heh!<br>
