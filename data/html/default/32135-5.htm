<html><body>Newbie Guide:<br>
At this level, if you prefer to use a speceific attack
skill, train hard to enhance that skill. Upgrade the
ones you already use most when you become
level 10.<br>
As a rule, novices acquire an attack skill first and
only later learn support skills. Therefore, it may
be helpful to learn passive skills like <font color="LEVEL">Weapon
Mastery, Armor Mastery, Magic Immunity</font> or <font color="LEVEL">Soul
Mastery.</font> I also recommend that you learn <font color="LEVEL">Rapid
Attack,</font> which temporarily enhances your attack
power.<br>
