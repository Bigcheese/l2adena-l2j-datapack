At that level, you can fight the <font color="LEVEL">Green Goblin and
 Hill Werewolves</font>. If you are skilled at hunting, you
 can also fight the <font color="LEVEL">Muertos Archer</font> or <font color="LEVEL">Mountain
 Fungus.</font><br>
You can find them at the center of the island,
south of the town. It is called the <font color="LEVEL">Hills of Gold.</font>
 You can find there every monster that I've
mentioned. Before going there, though, visit 
Captain <font color="LEVEL">Zerstorer Marcela.</font> If you catch a
monster on Hills of Gold, he will reward you. I
 don't know what you're doing know. but it will
 benefit you.<br>
By the way, be careful of the Muertos who are
 wandering around Hills of Gold -- they are no
 easy target, whatever their appearance. Fight
 them only after you have reached level 11.<br>
