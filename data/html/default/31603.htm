I, kiddo!<br>
Ha! Does my calling you "kiddo" offend you?<br>
Well, I've lived for undreds of years, so everyone is a kid to me!<br>
Heed my words, my young friend! I've never allowed anything to stand between me and my goals, not even decency!<br>
But recently, my past evil deeds have begun to haunt my dreams... I've begun to question my mercenary existence...<br>
What if I had lived and ordinary life?<br>
Maybe I'm just old and sentimental, eh?<br>
...<br>
Well, there's no use crying over spilt milk...<br>
I Have no choise now but to continue climbing until I fall...<br>
