Hello,<br>
Please have your L2J Express Credit Card ready for this transaction.<br><br>
Oh, wait you play on an L2J Server, that means you can put away that<br>
L2J Express Credit Card, and use your pocket change to pay for these buffs...<br><br>
I'd normally charge you 200 adena per buff, but since I think you're cute, I'll charge half off<br><br>
That means you pay 100 adena per buff only.<br><br>
*wink*Aren't I nice...<br><br>

What type of buffs would you like?<br><br>
