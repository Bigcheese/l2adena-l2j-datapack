<html><body>Fishing Guild Member Hilgendorf:<br>
Welcome, my young friend! Nice to meet you! It's a great day to go fishing!<br>
My family have been members of the fishing guild since my great-grandfather joined. In fact, that's why I was sent here to Rune. Not only is the fishing particularly challenging here, but it's become something of a hobby among the elite.<br>
