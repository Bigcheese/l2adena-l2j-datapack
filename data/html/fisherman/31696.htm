The fishing spots near here are the only ones in Elmore from which you can catch actual sea fish. Back during the Elmoreden Empire, they were famous throughout the kingdom. Now the lack of ships has revitalized them.<br>
Care to give it a try? If you catch something good, be sure to show it to me!<br>
