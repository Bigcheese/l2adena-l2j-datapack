Everything is plentiful here in Giran, which is why so many people spend their leisure time fishing. Care to try it?<br>
Ah, pardon me -- I forgot to introduce myself! I am Ofulle, the only officially licensed fishing professional in this territory! Come see me whenever you need bait, fishing gear or want to sell the fish you've caught. I'll by anything...except mermaids, that is! Ha ha ha!<br>
