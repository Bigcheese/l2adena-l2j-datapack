Heading out for an adventure, eh? Are you really planning on taking all that stuff? Let me give you some advice, kid. Don't weigh yourself down with all sorts of unnecessary equipment. Just take what you need. Leave the rest with me. The Iron Gate Guild will keep your items safe and secure until you come back.<br>
Better yet, you can even withdraw any items you deposit with us items from any city!<br>
