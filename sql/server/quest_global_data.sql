-- Table structure for global quest data (i.e. quest data not particular to a player)
-- Note: We had considered using character_quests with char_id = 0 for this, but decided
-- against it, primarily for aesthetic purposes, cleaningness of code, expectability, and
-- to keep char-related data purely as char-related data, global purely as global.
