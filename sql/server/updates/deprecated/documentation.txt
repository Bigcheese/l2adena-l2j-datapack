For a while, cummulative updates were here without a naming convention, just piling.

During the Kamael release we collected them all in a single file (see deprecated).

Any cummulative SQL update from now on, should be named like that:

YYYYMMDDupdate(_s).sql

For example, if only one update is done in a single day, let's say on January 1, 2008, then the
file shall be named:
20080101update.sql

However, if a more than one updates are all done on the same day, a sequence number will be added:
20080101update.sql
20080101update_1.sql
20080101update_2.sql
20080101update_3.sql
etc...
