-- How to configure the SQL based access level system :

-- There are two tables.

-- First one is named acess_levels and it's meant to define the different possible
-- groups a GM can belong to.

-- You can see in this table six predefined GM groups. Each group has a different
-- accessLevel, and GM's access_level in the characters table should match with
-- one of these. You could define as many groups as needed and give them whatever
-- number you wanted to, from 1 to 255. Nevertheless please note the fact that
-- there is one group that will be reserved for allmighty administrators, and this
-- group is bound to the following rules:

--    * There's no need/way to restrict the commands this group is able to run, its
--      members will be able to perform ANY admin_command.

--    * One number must be reserved for this group, and by default it is set to 127.

--    * In order to change this default group number or its name/title colors,
--      you should look at the Character.properties configuration file and
--      change the value of MasterAccessLevel, MasterNameColor and MasterTitleColor
--      respectively.

--    * You should better not use this group as a part of any childs hierarchy.

-- In our predefined set of examples, access_level=1 is for the highest admin,
-- and access_level=3 is for Event GMs.

-- The rest of the access_levels table columns are expected to be self explanatory.

-- And there is a second table named admin_command_access_rights and in this table
-- administrators should add every command they wanted GMs to use.

-- We left just one query here to show how commands should be added to the table:

-- INSERT IGNORE INTO `admin_command_access_rights` VALUES ('admin_admin','6');

-- If an administrator wanted to grant his GMs from group 4 the usage of the //para
-- command, he should just copy our example and replace values like this:

-- INSERT IGNORE INTO `admin_command_access_rights` VALUES ('admin_para','4');

-- So on, for each command there should be a record in this table. And it would be
-- advisable to use one query per command to avoid messups ;)
